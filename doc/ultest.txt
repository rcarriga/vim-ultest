INTRODUCTION                                             *ultest-introduction*


The ultimate testing plugin for Vim/NeoVim

Running tests should be as quick and painless as possible.
[vim-test](https://github.com/janko/vim-test) is a very powerful and extensive
testing plugin, but it can be cumbersome to configure and lacks some features
to make it feel like an integrated piece of your editor. Rather than replacing
vim-test altogether, vim-ultest makes it even better while maintaining the
ability to use your existing configuration. If you're already using vim-test
then switching to vim-ultest is as easy as installing and... well, that's
pretty much it.

The goal behind vim-ultest is to make running tests as seamless as possible.

  * Tests are run individually so that any errors can be addressed
    individually.
  * Tests are run in seperate threads (not just asynchronously on the same
    thread) so your Vim session will never be blocked.
  * When tests are complete, results can be viewed immediately or on command.
  * Utilise the existing power of vim-test by extending upon it.
